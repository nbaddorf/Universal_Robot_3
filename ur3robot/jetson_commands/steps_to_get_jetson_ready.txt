WIFI STUFF
sudo apt install backport-iwlwifi-dkms
Disable pcie aspm:
sudo nano /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf
add "pcie_aspm=off" after APPEND:
APPEND ${cbootargs} quiet pcie_aspm=off

I also downloaded the intel drivers for my wifi card but I dont know if that helped or not.

#I installed htop to see computer usage
sudo apt-get install htop
