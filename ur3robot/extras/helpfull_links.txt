Networking info:
(MAIN COMPUTER, NOT IN DOCKER)
  - When you use .local your computer sends out info asking for other computers with hostname to respond. (Avahi.) This works on Linux., and mac sort of.
  I cant ping my mac with .local, but my mac can ping other devices with .local.
  (ur3robot -> nick-ros-master.local works, ur3robot -> nicks-mbp.local doesnt work. nicks-mbp -> ur3robot.local works.)

  - If you dont use .local, then your dns server tries to resolve the host name. In this case it is our ros router which resolves these names. 
  (ur3robot -> nick-ros-master works, ur3robot -> nicks-mbp (works, but mac has to be set to not use my custom dns addblocker, because otherwise it wont resolve from our ros router).)

  (IN DOCKER)
  - Docker doesnt seem to pass on the .local avahi stuff, so that doesnt seem to work.
  Because of this, we are relying on the router to resolve hosts for us.


IF RUNNING OUT OF DISK SPACE:
