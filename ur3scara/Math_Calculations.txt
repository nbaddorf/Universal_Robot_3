Goals for this project:
    - Z system can lift 12 lb
    - Main arm can lift 8 lb
    - Nema 17 stepper motor has 42 N*cm
    - Timing Belt pully has 20 teeth 16mm diameter, 1 rev = 40mm ##I think this is correct


Z system lifting:
    - Torque = Force X Length
    Length = 8mm or 0.8cm
    Force = 53 Newtons
    Torque = 42.4 N*cm # I think this is correct, but I dont want to run the stepper at its full current at all time, but this is pretty cool

    Speed:
    lets say 100rpm max for motor;
    Worm gear is 17:1
    output belt pully spins at 5.8 rpm * 40mm = 235 mm per min
