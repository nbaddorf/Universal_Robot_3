# Universal_Robot_3
 The 3rd version of my ROS home robot. I hope this code can be useful to others, it is a work in progress. I am happy for suggestions and improvements, but really this is just a hobby project for me and I may not implement them. 
 
 Here is an instructable for this robot: https://www.instructables.com/A-Useful-Autonomous-Home-Robot-the-UR3/ 

 This robot is running ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18.04 with Docker on an Nvidia Jetson Nano. 

 Thanks for checking this out!


 Things To Do:

 - X test move base / localization
 - X make a new map
 - X figure out why ps3 camera is yellow and fix that
 - make sure ps3 tf is correct
 - measure kinect camera tf
 - try to calibrate kinects positions
 - Maybe release kinect_aux on github
 - Work on PCL
 - X Maybe make new laser filter using CPP
 - Figure out why my mecanum wheels are all the sudden leaving marks on the floor.
 - X collect custom dataset for YOLO model for bottle tops
 - Implement YOLO v8 or newer with custom dataset to detect bottle tops.
