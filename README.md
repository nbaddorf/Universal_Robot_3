# Universal_Robot_3
 The 3rd version of my ROS home robot


 Things To Do:

 - X test move base / localization
 - X make a new map
 - X figure out why ps3 camera is yellow and fix that
 - make sure ps3 tf is correct
 - measure kinect camera tf
 - try to calibrate kinects positions
 - Maybe release kinect_aux on github
 - Work on PCL
 - X Maybe make new laser filter using CPP
